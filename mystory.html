                    <li>Growing up, my dad worked in the IT field so from a very young age I encountered my first computer.</li></br>
                    <li>I remember watching my dad take computers apart, and I always thought the inside looked just like a miniature city. I didn’t understand how the little parts contributed to a functioning computer, but nevertheless, it was an educational experience for me.</li></br>
                    <li>Having immigrated to the U.S. at a young age, I relied heavily on the internet to stay connected to family, friends, and news abroad. I spent many hours on the computer from pre-teen years. It’s how I learned to type in two languages fluently, and it helps me as an adult today.</li></br>
                    <li>When I was a teenager, I loved editing personal blogs. I spent a lot of time customizing templates. I didn’t do anything advanced, but I always enjoyed how you could make a page look so different with the smallest tweaks. I still remember my favorite hex color code at the time, <span class="hex">#ff3366!</span></li></br>
                    <li>I’m slowly learning how a website works. I enjoy exploring different webpages and wonder how things work on the inside & outside. I hope to be able to build a professional website from scratch that showcases my work as an artist and also as a budding web developer.</li>
